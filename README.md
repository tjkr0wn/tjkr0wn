### Hi, I'm Tarek Joumaa!

```About me```
I'm a iOS security researcher. I love breaking bootchains and kernels.

I started research into iOS security in 2019 and I've enjoyed learning about all aspects of the iPhone and how it operates.
My main focus for now is reversing the iOS kernel for fun and hopefully stumble upon some bugs.

```Programming languages```

```C
#define L "C/C++"
```

```python
l = "Python"
```

```C
asm volatile(""
"ldr x1, =asm"
"ldr x2, [x1]"
"ldr x3, =l"
"str x2, [x3]"
);
```

```Where I'm based:``` 
*North America*
*EST Time zone*

```Discord```
```C
  #define H "tjkr0wn #4141"
```

```Email```
```C
const char s[12] = "@icloud.com";
char n[23] = "tarekjoumaa";
strcat(&n, &s);
```
