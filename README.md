### Hi, I'm Tarek Joumaa!

About me: ```I'm a iOS security and exlpoit enthusiast! I love breaking bootchains, kernels, and more.```

I started research into iOS security in 2019 and I've enjoyed learning about all aspects of the iPhone and how it operates.
Currently, I'm reversing the iOS kernel to gain experience and hopefully stumble upon some bugs.
